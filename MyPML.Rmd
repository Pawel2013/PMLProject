####Question:

The goal of this project is to build the predictor, which can answer the question:
What is the manner in which 6  participants are doing a particular activity ?.
The data this project uses are from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.Participants performed  barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.The full description of the "Human Activity Recognition" experiment is given here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har

####Input Data:

The training data comes from this source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv.

The test data comes from this source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv.

####Features

After downloading and reading the training and test set I noticed, that there are 160 variables in both sets.
There is a column "new window" with "yes" or "no" values. For "yes" value in row -  statistical properties of some feature are given, but as we can see, the values are missed up. If I understand we don't need to mimmic original method applyied in author's paper - using rooling window, to calculate this statistical features (skewness, kurtosis, variance, etc.). Instead we must clean the data, because of lot of "NA" and "#DIV/0!" values and use almost the rest of columns. I suggest to remove first 8 columns.
As a result we have set of 52 features in both cleaned sets, plus "classe"" feature as outcome in training set.

Are these features correlated. To find it we can use....

####Algorithm

I decided to use following 3 algorithms for comparison:
Random Forest
Generalized Boosted Regression Models
and
Support Vector Machines

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Read all training set
training <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Pawel/Downloads/pml-training.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
# Select rows with new_window=="yes"
trainingYES <- training #[(training$new_window=="yes"),]
# remove all columns with NA or "#DIV/0!"
trainingYESwithoutNA <- trainingYES[ , apply(trainingYES, 2, function(x) !any(x=="" || x=="#DIV/0!" || is.na(x)))]
# remove unnecessary columns
train <- trainingYESwithoutNA[-(0:7)]

# Read all test set
testing <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Pawel/Downloads/pml-testing.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
# remove all columns with NA or "#DIV/0!"
testingYESwithoutNA <- testing[ , apply(testing, 2, function(x) !any(x=="" || x=="#DIV/0!" || is.na(x)))]
# remove unnecessary columns
test <- testingYESwithoutNA[-(0:7)]
```
