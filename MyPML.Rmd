This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Read all training set
training <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Pawel/Downloads/pml-training.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
# Select rows with new_window=="yes"
trainingYES <- training #[(training$new_window=="yes"),]
# remove all columns with NA or "#DIV/0!"
trainingYESwithoutNA <- trainingYES[ , apply(trainingYES, 2, function(x) !any(x=="" || x=="#DIV/0!" || is.na(x)))]
# remove unnecessary columns
train <- trainingYESwithoutNA[-(0:7)]

# Read all test set
testing <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Pawel/Downloads/pml-testing.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
# remove all columns with NA or "#DIV/0!"
testingYESwithoutNA <- testing[ , apply(testing, 2, function(x) !any(x=="" || x=="#DIV/0!" || is.na(x)))]
# remove unnecessary columns
test <- testingYESwithoutNA[-(0:7)]
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
